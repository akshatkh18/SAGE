## 🤔 Why SAGE?

Most AutoML tools are black boxes. They automate the pipeline but never tell you *why* they made each decision.

SAGE is different:
- Every preprocessing step comes with a **human-readable justification**
- The insight engine detects data quality issues with **severity levels** (critical / warning / info)
- SHAP explainability translates model decisions into **plain English**
- Every experiment is **logged to SQLite** so you can compare runs over time
- The final output is a **professional PDF report** you can share with anyone

## ⚙️ Features

| Module | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔍 **EDA** | Auto-profiles your dataset — missing values, skew, outliers, correlations, data quality insights |
| 🧹 **Preprocessing** | Adaptive pipeline — imputation, encoding, winsorizing, datetime extraction, ID detection |
| 🏟️ **Model Arena** | Trains 7 models, ranks by F1/R², runs Optuna tuning on the winner |
| 💡 **Explainability** | SHAP summary, bar, and waterfall plots + natural language explanations |
| 🗃️ **Experiment Memory** | SQLite logging — compare every run you've ever done |
| 📄 **PDF Report** | Professional 7-page report with charts, tables, and plain-language summary |

# Overview

SAGE (Smart Adaptive Guided Experimentation) is an end-to-end Explainable AutoML platform that automates the complete machine learning workflow, from dataset analysis to model interpretation.

Unlike conventional AutoML tools that often behave as black boxes, SAGE explains every preprocessing decision, interprets model predictions using SHAP, tracks experiments in SQLite, and generates professional PDF reports for reproducibility.

The platform is designed for students, researchers, data scientists, and machine learning practitioners who want automation without sacrificing transparency.

---

# Why SAGE?

Traditional AutoML platforms usually focus on obtaining the best model while hiding intermediate decisions.

SAGE focuses on **automation with explainability**.

Key differences include:

- Automated exploratory data analysis
- Adaptive preprocessing pipelines
- Human-readable preprocessing explanations
- Multi-model benchmarking
- Automatic hyperparameter optimization
- SHAP-based explainability
- Experiment history
- Professional PDF reports

---
